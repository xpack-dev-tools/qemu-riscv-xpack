## Documentation

The original documentation is available on-line:

- https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv-xpack/builds/)
